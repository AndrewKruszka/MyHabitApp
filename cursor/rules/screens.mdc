# /screens â€” Screen-Level Rules

## Purpose
Top-level route-driven views. These files:
- Organize high-level page layouts and app flows
- Compose reusable components + context

## Pattern
Each screen should have:
- index.tsx
- styles.ts
- (optional) hooks.ts

## Guidelines
- Use the wavy gradient background consistently
- Respect visual spacing (24px+ between blocks)
- Keep navigation logic within screen or AppNavigator

## To-Do
- [ ] Add AuthNavigator for login (v2)
- [ ] Create a splash screen / loading fallback
