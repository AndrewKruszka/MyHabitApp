# My Habit App

## Project Description

The Daily Tracking App is a modern, mobile-first application designed to help users monitor their daily habits, mood patterns, and lifestyle activities. Built in React Native (using Expo) with SQLite for offline-first storage, the app focuses on simplicity, personalization, and actionable insights.

Users can:
- Track daily habits using customizable options.
- Record mood throughout the day (single or segmented entries).
- Create dynamic sub-reports for detailed activities like workouts, golf rounds, or study sessions.
- View historical trends via calendars and graphs.
- Receive AI-generated insights explaining mood patterns and habit influences.
- Provide feedback on AI insights to refine future suggestions.

The MVP is fully offline capable, with future plans to integrate cloud backup and account-based sync through Firebase.

- **Mood Analysis:** Both simple (daily mood) and segmented (morning/afternoon/night) tracking.
- **Actionable Insights:** OpenAI-based daily reflections, growing smarter with user feedback.
- **Clean UX:** Minimalist UI using a calming, science-forward design based on Style Guide 1 (Blue + Teal palette).
